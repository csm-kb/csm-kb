All rights reserved. This is a personal license governing data protection, privacy, and identity.

"Author" is Kane Bruce.

"Consent" is the Author's explicit consent, via a mutual legally-binding identity-verified signature through the DocuSign platform, that directly addresses the inquirer, in response to a direct request by said inquirer. The signature must be initiated by the Author through DocuSign, and the signed document must include the intent for Data handling and/or processing.

"Data" is this license and any information, media, links, folders, personally identifying information, or other data contents shared alongside this license. This extends to anywhere the Author shares said Data.

The original creators of data contents shared as Data own their respective copyrights, and that respective data is governed by them and thus not bound by this license. GitHub, the platform hosting this Data, is authorized to handle this Data per their relevant data handling and protection policies.

This license extends any and all relevant sovereign statutes or laws that apply to Data, and is not a replacement for them. This license applies to all previous versions of Data, including previous versions of this license (for which the change history can be viewed through git commit history), until such time this license states that it no longer applies to future versions of Data, when specified by the Author.

Data is prohibited from any usage, handing, processing, distribution, or redistribution without Consent.

Data may not be duplicated, transferred, removed, modified, or deleted, by any means (including screenshot, photograph, video, HTML print, embed, or other means) without Consent. Unauthorized Data handling, protection, or impersonation will be prosecuted to the fullest extent that regulations allow.

This license applies irrespective of user, origin, intent, or duration, for the purpose of personal data protection and privacy.

If you have concerns about this license and you are not an original creator of media shared as Data, please consult the personal data concerns being addressed, and consult your local civil dispute laws, as well as applicable United States state and federal statutes, for consequences of privacy or identity violations.
